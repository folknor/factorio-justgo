# Just GO!

A teeny tiny mod that instantly pops you into a vehicle when you place it from a filtered player main inventory slot, and it is within the reach of your character.

It also picks the vehicle up again when you disembark, but this can be turned off (it is enabled by default) with a runtime per-player option in the mod settings.

Works very nice in combination with my other addon, [Automated Fuel and Ammo](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/folk/folk-fill). Please take a look at [my other addons](https://mods.factorio.com/user/folk) as well. I'm sure you'll love some of them :-)

## How to make it work

1. Filter any slot in your main character inventory to a car/tank or locomotive (middle-click the slot with your mouse)
2. Place the vehicle in the slot
3. Either pick it up with the mouse or put the item in your quickbar
4. Place the vehicle on the ground within your characters reach

You will be instantly put into the vehicle. Now just go!

## Settings

There is a runtime per-user setting (enabled by default) that tells the mod whether or not it should automatically mine (pick up) quickbar-filtered vehicles when you exit them.
